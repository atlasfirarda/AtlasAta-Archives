# AtlasAta Private Repository

This private repository serves as a central hub for all of my development projects, spanning multiple programming languages, frameworks, and technologies. It includes a diverse range of work, from AI-driven applications to UI/UX design assets, covering areas such as:

- **WinForms, WPF, and C#**: Desktop applications with robust user interfaces.
- **C++, Python, and Java**: Core algorithmic implementations, machine learning models, and backend services.
- **AI Projects**: Upscaling solutions like **ESRGAN**, **RIFE AI**, and other AI-powered utilities.
- **Web Development**: Projects built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for modern web interfaces.
- **Assets**: Collection of toolbar icons, PNGs, and other design resources for various applications.

This repository is a workspace for evolving and experimental projects, focusing on innovation, performance optimization, and cross-platform integration.
